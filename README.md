Sproxel
=======

Sproxel is a 3d interface designed to let the user quickly create and edit voxel-based 3d models. The creation process and resulting geometry can be thought of as an extension to 2d pixel art.

Sproxel is in its infancy, but can already generate sprites for custom game engines.


Building
--------

Sproxel requires [Qt](http://qt-project.org/downloads), and on Windows, [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express).
